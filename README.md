It's ugly and it's last minute but this may come closest to hitting the mark so far. 

Biggest issue beyond not having time for CSS: I followed the class activity very closely to pull the still/animated URLs for the click-to-animate gif function and never got it to work?? Annoyed that the time didn't pan out. On the other hand there were a few things that did fall into place and overall I'm much happier than my prior assignment. 

I also really really wanted all of my divs to generate via js, but I had to abandon the form-submit div due to time.
